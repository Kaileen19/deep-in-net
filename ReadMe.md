What is RJ-45 cable?

An RJ-45 cable is a type of network cable used for Ethernet connections. It has a rectangular connector with 8 pins and is used to connect devices like computers, routers, and switches for wired data transmission in local area networks (LANs). It is the standard cable for most wired networking setups.

Understand what is the difference between straight through and crossover RJ-45 cables.

1. Straight-through Cable:

   Wires: The wires are arranged the same on both ends.
   Use: It is used to connect different devices, like a computer to a router or a switch to a router.

2. Crossover Cable:
   (Also used for our example image-1.png)
   Wires: The wires are arranged differently on each end (two pairs are swapped).
   Use: It is used to connect similar devices, like two computers or two switches directly to each other.

In summary:

    Straight-through = different devices (e.g., computer to router).
    Crossover = similar devices (e.g., computer to computer).
